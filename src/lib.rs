//! _ðŸŽµ Immutability never bothered me anyway ðŸŽ¶_
//!
//! This crate provides various "Frozen" collections.
//!
//! These are append-only collections where references to entries can be held
//! on to even across insertions. This is safe because these collections only
//! support storing data that's present behind some indirection -- i.e. `String`,
//! `Vec<T>`, `Box<T>`, etc, and they only yield references to the data behind the
//! allocation (`&str`, `&[T]`, and `&T` respectively)
//!
//! The typical use case is having a global cache of strings or other data which the rest of the program borrows from.
